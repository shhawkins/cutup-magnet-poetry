        Winter kept us warm, covering earth in forgetful snow, feeding a little life with dried tubers. Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee with a shower of rain, 
        we stopped in the colonnade, and went on in the streets of the city, feeling the wind. The trees were green and the air was fresh, but the city was full of strange sounds and unknown faces. 
        The cold remained, hidden in the corners of the buildings, yet the warmth of the season had begun to stir. Each new season brings its own challenge: spring with its revival of life, 
        winter with its retreat into the inner world. We are forever caught between the forces of memory and renewal, of dreams and the waking world, living through the storms of life that bring both destruction and growth.`,

        text: `We sat together at one summer's end,
That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   
And you and I, and talked of poetry.
I said, 'A line will take us hours maybe;
Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,   
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   
Better go down upon your marrow-bones   
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   
Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   
For to articulate sweet sounds together
Is to work harder than all these, and yet   
Be thought an idler by the noisy set
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   
The martyrs call the world.'
                                          And thereupon
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   
There's many a one shall find out all heartache   
On finding that her voice is sweet and low   
Replied, 'To be born woman is to know—
Although they do not talk of it at school—
That we must labour to be beautiful.'
I said, 'It's certain there is no fine thing   
Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.
There have been lovers who thought love should be   
So much compounded of high courtesy   
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   
Precedents out of beautiful old books;   
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'

We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   
We saw the last embers of daylight die,   
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   
Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell   
About the stars and broke in days and years.

I had a thought for no one's but your ears:   
That you were beautiful, and that I strove   
To love you in the old high way of love;
That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown   
As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.

Turning and turning in the widening gyre   
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst   
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.   
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out   
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   
The darkness drops again; but now I know   
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?

The brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,
The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,
And all that famous harmony of leaves,
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.

A girl arose that had red mournful lips
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;

Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,
And all that lamentation of the leaves,
Could but compose man's image and his cry.`,

And the great indiscreet trees

Touched the glass with their leaves,

In malice, quite close, quite close.

Sitting in my deep chair,

Half-naked, hands clasped together,

On the floor, little feet, so fine,

So fine, shivered with pleasure.

I watched, the beeswax colour

Of a truant ray of sun-glow

Flit about her smile, and over

Her breast – a fly on the rose.

– I kissed her delicate ankle.

She gave an abrupt sweet giggle

Chiming in clear trills,

A pretty laugh of crystal.

Her little feet under her slip

Sped away: 'Will you desist!'

Allowing that first bold act,

Her laugh pretended to punish!

– Trembling under my lips,

Poor things, I gently kissed her lids.

– She threw her vapid head back.

'Oh! That's worse, that is!'...

'Sir, I've two words to say to you...'

– I planted the rest on her breast

In a kiss that made her laugh

With a laugh of readiness....

– She was barely dressed though,

And the great indiscreet trees

Touched the glass with their leaves

In malice, quite close, quite close.

As I floated down impassive Rivers,
I felt myself no longer pulled by ropes:
The Redskins took my hauliers for targets,
And nailed them naked to their painted posts.

Carrying Flemish wheat or English cotton,
I was indifferent to all my crews.
The Rivers let me float down as I wished,
When the victims and the sounds were through.

Into the furious breakers of the sea,
Deafer than the ears of a child, last winter,
I ran! And the Peninsulas sliding by me
Never heard a more triumphant clamour.

The tempest blessed my sea-borne arousals.
Lighter than a cork I danced those waves
They call the eternal churners of victims,
Ten nights, without regret for the lighted bays!

Sweeter than sour apples to the children
The green ooze spurting through my hull's pine,
Washed me of vomit and the blue of wine,
Carried away my rudder and my anchor.

Then I bathed in the Poem of the Sea,
Infused with stars, the milk-white spume blends,
Grazing green azures: where ravished, bleached
Flotsam, a drowned man in dream descends.

Where, staining the blue, sudden deliriums
And slow tremors under the gleams of fire,
Stronger than alcohol, vaster than our rhythms,
Ferment the bitter reds of our desire!

I knew the skies split apart by lightning,
Waterspouts, breakers, tides: I knew the night,
The Dawn exalted like a crowd of doves,
I saw what men think they've seen in the light!

I saw the low sun, stained with mystic terrors,
Illuminate long violet coagulations,
Like actors in a play, a play that's ancient,
Waves rolling back their trembling of shutters!

I dreamt the green night of blinded snows,
A kiss lifted slow to the eyes of seas,
The circulation of unheard-of flows,
Sung phosphorus's blue-yellow awakenings!

For months on end, I've followed the swell
That batters at the reefs like terrified cattle,
Not dreaming the Three Marys' shining feet
Could muzzle with their force the Ocean's hell!

I've struck Floridas, you know, beyond belief,
Where eyes of panthers in human skins,
Merge with the flowers! Rainbow bridles, beneath
the seas' horizon, stretched out to shadowy fins!

I've seen the great swamps boil, and the hiss
Where a whole whale rots among the reeds!
Downfalls of water among tranquilities,
Distances showering into the abyss.

Nacreous waves, silver suns, glaciers, ember skies!
Gaunt wrecks deep in the brown vacuities
Where the giant eels riddled with parasites
Fall, with dark perfumes, from the twisted trees!

I would have liked to show children dolphins
Of the blue wave, the golden singing fish.
– Flowering foams rocked me in my drift,
At times unutterable winds gave me wings.

Sometimes, a martyr tired of poles and zones,
The sea whose sobs made my roilings sweet
Showed me its shadow flowers with yellow mouths
And I rested like a woman on her knees...

Almost an isle, blowing across my sands, quarrels
And droppings of pale-eyed clamorous gulls,
And I scudded on while, over my frayed lines,
Drowned men sank back in sleep beneath my hull!...

Now I, a boat lost in the hair of bays,
Hurled by the hurricane through bird-less ether,
I, whose carcass, sodden with salt-sea water,
No Monitor or Hanseatic vessel could recover:

Freed, in smoke, risen from the violet fog,
I, who pierced the red skies like a wall,
Bearing the sweets that delight true poets,
Lichens of sunlight, gobbets of azure:

Who ran, stained with electric moonlets,
A crazed plank, companied by black sea-horses,
When Julys were crushing with cudgel blows
Skies of ultramarine in burning funnels:

I, who trembled to hear those agonies
Of rutting Behemoths and dark Maelstroms,
Eternal spinner of blue immobilities,
I regret the ancient parapets of Europe!

I've seen archipelagos of stars! And isles
Whose maddened skies open for the sailor:
– Is it in depths of night you sleep, exiled,
Million birds of gold, O future Vigour? –

But, truly, I've wept too much! The Dawns
Are heart-breaking, each moon hell, each sun bitter:
Fierce love has swallowed me in drunken torpors.
O let my keel break! Tides draw me down!

If I want one pool in Europe, it's the cold
Black pond where into the scented night
A child squatting filled with sadness launches
A boat as frail as a May butterfly.

Bathed in your languor, waves, I can no longer
Cut across the wakes of cotton ships,
Or sail against the pride of flags, ensigns,
Or swim the dreadful gaze of prison ships.`,

O Venus, beauty of the skies,
To whom a thousand temples rise,
Gaily false in gentle smiles,
Full of love-perplexing wiles;
O goddess, from my heart remove
The wasting cares and pains of love.

If ever thou hast kindly heard
A song in soft distress preferred,
Propitious to my tuneful vow,
A gentle goddess, hear me now.
Descend, thou bright immortal guest,
In all thy radiant charms confessed.

Thou once didst leave almighty Jove
And all the golden roofs above:
The car thy wanton sparrows drew,
Hovering in air they lightly flew;
As to my bower they winged their way
I saw their quivering pinions play.

The birds dismissed (while you remain)
Bore back their empty car again:
Then you, with looks divinely mild,
In every heavenly feature smiled,
And asked what new complaints I made,
And why I called you to my aid?

What frenzy in my bosom raged,
And by what cure to be assuaged?
What gentle youth I would allure,
Whom in my artful toils secure?
Who does thy tender heart subdue,
Tell me, my Sappho, tell me who?

Though now he shuns thy longing arms,
He soon shall court thy slighted charms;
Though now thy offerings he despise,
He soon to thee shall sacrifice;
Though now he freezes, he soon shall burn,
And be thy victim in his turn.

Celestial visitant, once more
Thy needful presence I implore.
In pity come, and ease my grief,
Bring my distempered soul relief,
Favour thy suppliant's hidden fires,
And give me all my heart desires.`,

        And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;

        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        Must give us pause: there's the respect

Gradually as the sky whitened a dark line lay on the horizon dividing the sea from the sky and the grey cloth became barred with thick strokes moving, one after another, beneath the surface, following each other, pursuing each other, perpetually.

        As they neared the shore each bar rose, heaped itself, broke and swept a thin veil of white water across the sand. The wave paused, and then drew out again, sighing like a sleeper whose breath comes and goes unconsciously. Gradually the dark bar on the horizon became clear as if the sediment in an old wine-bottle has sunk and left the glass green. Behind it, too, the sky cleared as if the white sediment there had sunk, or as if the arm of a woman couched beneath the horizon had raised a lamp and flat bars of white, green and yellow spread across the sky like the blades of a fan. Then she raised her lamp higher and the air seemed to become fibrous and to tear away from the green surface flickering and flaming in red and yellow fibres like the smoky fire that roars from a bonfire. Gradually the fibres of the burning bonfire were fused into one haze, one incandescence which lifted the weight of the woollen grey sky on top of it and turned it to a million atoms of soft blue. The surface of the sea slowly became transparent and lay rippling and sparkling until the dark stripes were almost rubbed out. Slowly the arm that held the lamp raised it higher and then higher until a broad flame became visible; an arc of fire burnt on the rim of the horizon, and all round it the sea blazed gold.
        
        The light struck upon the trees in the garden, making one leaf transparent and then another. One bird chirped high up; there was a pause; another chirped lower down. The sun sharpened the walls of the house, and rested like the tip of a fan upon a white blind and made a blue finger-print of shadow under the leaf by the bedroom window. The blind stirred slightly, but all within was dim and unsubstantial. The birds sang their blank melody outside.`,

The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat. The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck.

He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.

        Every man bears the whole stamp of the human condition, Montaigne wrote. Through the intimate and reflective essays that make up *The Essays*, 
        he examines the human experience from the inside out, exploring questions of identity, morality, and the nature of knowledge itself. Montaigne's writing is filled 
        with introspection and intellectual curiosity, seeking to uncover the contradictions within human nature. He invites readers to engage with the world 
        in a deeply personal way, not merely as passive observers but as active participants in the search for meaning. In Montaigne's view, the true path to wisdom 
        lies in understanding oneself, for only by doing so can we hope to understand the broader world. His thoughts resonate even today as we continue our own 
        quest for self-discovery and understanding.`,

        unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life. 
        *Walden* is Thoreau's manifesto of radical simplicity and self-reliance, born from two years in a cabin near Walden Pond. With sharp observation and quiet defiance, 
        he challenges materialism, routine, and blind conformity. His reflections roam from the texture of morning light to the moral imperative of civil disobedience. 
        Thoreau urges readers to strip life to its barest essentials, finding freedom not in abundance but in awareness. His prose, meditative and bold, continues to speak 
        to anyone searching for a more deliberate, meaningful existence.`,

  that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who had ever been alive. Baldwin's work in *The Fire Next Time* 
  is part memoir, part moral witness, and wholly uncompromising. With lyrical force and righteous clarity, he exposes the violence beneath American racial injustice 
  and the psychic toll it takes on both oppressed and oppressor. He writes of Harlem, of churches, of family, and of fear—fear of white people, yes, 
  but also the deeper fear that love might be impossible in such a country. Yet Baldwin does not despair. He calls instead for confrontation—honest, unflinching, 
  and ultimately redemptive. His vision of justice is inseparable from love, and his voice—prophetic, intimate, urgent—still echoes through the present moment.`,

  a demand to remain awake, to preserve the space of thought and moral judgment. She believed that political responsibility begins with attention, with speech, 
  and with the courage to act when others remain silent. Her writing is dense but electric, filled with a deep belief in the necessity of human freedom.`,

  In *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave*, he recounts his brutal experience under slavery with unsparing clarity and moral urgency. 
  He describes the whipping of his aunt, the songs sung by enslaved people, the hypocrisy of religious slaveholders, and the life-altering power of learning to read. 
  Douglass teaches himself literacy in secret, and that knowledge becomes a spark of liberation. His escape to freedom is not only physical but intellectual, 
  grounded in a belief that words can change the world. His autobiography is not merely testimony but argument—against slavery, yes, but also against the degradation 
  of human dignity anywhere. Through measured prose and mounting conviction, Douglass transforms personal pain into political power. His voice remains a cornerstone

These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.

        My work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been urged to publish this Abstract. I have more especially been induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the Malay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of species. Last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published in the third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my work—the latter having read my sketch of 1844—honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr. Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.`,

Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts.

God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters...

From dust to living breath, creation poured forth word by word. Land separated from sea. Stars placed with purpose. Creatures crawling, flying, swimming—the world teeming with order. And man, formed of clay, given dominion, yet called to tend and walk in humility.

Gaia alone gave birth to Uranus, the starry sky, who became her husband. Together they produced the Titans, the Cyclopes, and the Hecatoncheires. But Uranus was a cruel father, imprisoning his children in the depths of the Earth.

Gaia, grieving for her children, created a great sickle and urged her children to take revenge. Only Cronus, the youngest Titan, was willing. He ambushed his father and castrated him, throwing his genitals into the sea. From the blood that fell upon the Earth, the Furies, the Giants, and the Meliae were born.

Cronus became the ruler of the universe, but he feared a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him. So he swallowed each of his children as they were born. His wife Rhea, grieving for her children, hid Zeus when he was born and gave Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead.

When Zeus grew up, he forced Cronus to disgorge his siblings, and together they waged war against the Titans. After ten years of battle, the Olympians emerged victorious, and Zeus became the ruler of the gods.

The gods lived on Mount Olympus, where they feasted on ambrosia and nectar, and ruled over the affairs of mortals. Each god had their own domain: Zeus ruled the sky, Poseidon the sea, Hades the underworld, Hera marriage, Athena wisdom, Apollo the sun, Artemis the moon, Ares war, Aphrodite love, Hephaestus fire, Hermes messages, and Dionysus wine.

The gods were not always just or kind. They often interfered in human affairs, sometimes helping, sometimes harming. They fell in love with mortals, fought among themselves, and played tricks on each other. Their stories explain the mysteries of the world and teach lessons about human nature.`,

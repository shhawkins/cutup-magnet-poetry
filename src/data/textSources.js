        title: "T.S. Eliot",
        text: `April is the cruellest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing memory and desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain. 
        Winter kept us warm, covering earth in forgetful snow, feeding a little life with dried tubers. Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee with a shower of rain, 
        we stopped in the colonnade, and went on in the streets of the city, feeling the wind. The trees were green and the air was fresh, but the city was full of strange sounds and unknown faces. 
        The cold remained, hidden in the corners of the buildings, yet the warmth of the season had begun to stir. Each new season brings its own challenge: spring with its revival of life, 
        winter with its retreat into the inner world. We are forever caught between the forces of memory and renewal, of dreams and the waking world, living through the storms of life that bring both destruction and growth.`,

        title: "W.B. Yeats",
        text: `The world is full of magical things, patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper. In the stillness of the night, under the pale moon, Yeats finds the voice of his soul. 
        'Turning and turning in the widening gyre,' he writes, the falcon unable to hear the falconer, a symbol of the chaos that will unfold. The falcon, the bird of prey, 
        once so connected to its master, now flies blindly, symbolizing the loss of control in the face of turbulent times. In another poem, he expresses the tension between the intellect and the heart, 
        between the soul and the body, the spiritual and the earthly realms. His deep belief in the supernatural gives rise to ideas that transcend reality, calling forth visions of ancient gods 
        and mystic rites. He was both deeply involved in the mystical movements of his time and a skeptic, bridging the realms of the occult and the rational mind. His poetry dances between the personal and the universal, 
        between the emotional highs of love and the despairing depths of human suffering. He understood the fragility of both the individual and the nation, and his works reflect a world torn apart by conflicting ideologies, beliefs, and desires. 
        Yeats, a seeker of truths in both the material and spiritual worlds, knew that the greatest battles fought are often those within oneself.`,

      rimbaud: {
        title: "Arthur Rimbaud",
        text: `I have stretched ropes from steeple to steeple; garlands from window to window; golden chains from star to star, and I dance. The city's towers are alive with storks; their cries pierce the fog. 
        I've seen specters in the windows, heard the bells toll midnight through the mist. I’ve sailed through the ages, transcending the borders of the human experience. The world that Rimbaud presents is one of both surreal beauty and dark chaos, 
        a place where love and death are inextricably linked. His verse flows like a river, winding through landscapes of both the fantastical and the terrifying. The natural world becomes a metaphor for human turmoil and longing, 
        as his words pierce through the veil of reality to show us the mystical and unknown. Rimbaud’s exploration of the limits of language and the boundaries of the self represents a radical break from tradition, a call to see the world in new, transformative ways. 
        His poetry offers a window into a world that cannot be understood with reason alone, a place where passion and madness intersect.`,

        title: "Emily Dickinson",
        text: `Because I could not stop for Death – He kindly stopped for me – The Carriage held but just Ourselves – And Immortality. 
        We slowly drove – He knew no haste, And I had put away my labor and my leisure too, For His Civility. We passed the School, where Children strove 
        At Recess – in the Ring – We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain – We passed the Setting Sun – Or rather – He passed Us – The Dews drew quivering and Chill – 
        For only Gossamer, my Gown – My Tippet – only Tulle – We paused before a House that seemed A Swelling of the Ground – The Roof was scarcely visible – 
        The Cornice – in the Ground – Since then – 'Tis Centuries – and yet Feels shorter than the Day I first surmised the Horses' Heads – Were toward Eternity – 
        The speaker reflects on the journey toward death with acceptance, seeing it as an inevitable companion that guides them into the afterlife. The imagery of the carriage, the school, and the setting sun evokes the passage of time and the inevitable march toward the end.`,

      sappho: {
        title: "Sappho",
        text: `Like a golden flower growing wild, Sappho’s poetry flourishes in its beauty and passion, bringing to life the complexities of human emotion and desire. Her works transcend the ordinary and speak to the universal aspects of the soul. 
        Sappho's love poems, though often directed toward women, speak to a broader sense of longing and connection that transcends gender. Her words radiate with the intensity of emotions that spring from the deepest well of the human heart. 
        "How can I not love you?" she asks, and in that simple question, she distills the essence of longing. Her poetry is steeped in beauty, yet laced with a subtle melancholy as she reflects on the fleeting nature of love and time itself. 
        She paints with words, creating vivid, timeless images of love’s passion and its inevitable loss. Even as she explores love's joy, she contemplates its fleeting nature, finding a melancholy beauty in the transitory moments of connection between people. 
        Sappho’s voice remains one of the most influential in history, her words still echoing through time, calling to us across the centuries.`,

        title: "Shakespeare",
        text: `To be, or not to be: that is the question:
        Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
        And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
        No more; and by a sleep to say we end
        The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
        That flesh is heir to, ’tis a consummation
        Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;
        To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;
        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        Must give us pause: there’s the respect
        That makes calamity of so long life;
        For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
        The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
        The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,
        The insolence of office and the spurns
        That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
        When he himself might his quietus make
        With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
        To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
        But that the dread of something after death,
        The undiscover’d country from whose bourn
        No traveller returns, puzzles the will
        And makes us rather bear those ills we have
        Than fly to others that we know not of?
        Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
        And thus the native hue of resolution
        Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
        And enterprises of great pith and moment
        With this regard their currents turn awry,
        And lose the name of action.–Soft you now!
        The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
        Be all my sins remember’d.`,

        title: "Virginia Woolf",
        text: `The sun had not yet risen. The sea was indistinguishable from the sky, except that the sea was slightly creased as if a cloth had wrinkles in it. Gradually as the sky whitened a dark line lay on the horizon dividing the sea from the sky and the grey cloth became barred with thick strokes moving, one after another, beneath the surface, following each other, pursuing each other, perpetually.

        As they neared the shore each bar rose, heaped itself, broke and swept a thin veil of white water across the sand. The wave paused, and then drew out again, sighing like a sleeper whose breath comes and goes unconsciously. Gradually the dark bar on the horizon became clear as if the sediment in an old wine-bottle has sunk and left the glass green. Behind it, too, the sky cleared as if the white sediment there had sunk, or as if the arm of a woman couched beneath the horizon had raised a lamp and flat bars of white, green and yellow spread across the sky like the blades of a fan. Then she raised her lamp higher and the air seemed to become fibrous and to tear away from the green surface flickering and flaming in red and yellow fibres like the smoky fire that roars from a bonfire. Gradually the fibres of the burning bonfire were fused into one haze, one incandescence which lifted the weight of the woollen grey sky on top of it and turned it to a million atoms of soft blue. The surface of the sea slowly became transparent and lay rippling and sparkling until the dark stripes were almost rubbed out. Slowly the arm that held the lamp raised it higher and then higher until a broad flame became visible; an arc of fire burnt on the rim of the horizon, and all round it the sea blazed gold.
        
        The light struck upon the trees in the garden, making one leaf transparent and then another. One bird chirped high up; there was a pause; another chirped lower down. The sun sharpened the walls of the house, and rested like the tip of a fan upon a white blind and made a blue finger-print of shadow under the leaf by the bedroom window. The blind stirred slightly, but all within was dim and unsubstantial. The birds sang their blank melody outside.`,

      melville: {
        title: "Herman Melville",
        text: `Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, 
        I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. 
        Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing 
        before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, 
        that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off— 
        then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. Melville's narrator, Ishmael, seeks refuge in the vastness of the ocean, 
        both a literal and metaphorical space that holds the promise of freedom and self-discovery. The sea, in Melville’s world, becomes a stage for existential reflection, 
        a symbol of the challenges and absurdities of life itself.`,

        The environmental impact of human activity is becoming more apparent each day, and experts continue to warn about the future consequences. 
        Meanwhile, researchers in Antarctica have reported alarming findings, with the ice sheet retreating at an accelerated pace. These developments serve as stark reminders

        text: `Hail to thee, O Nile! Who manifests thyself over this land, and comes to give life to Egypt! Mysterious is thy issuing forth from the darkness, 
        on this day whereon it is celebrated! Watering the orchards created by Ra, thee, the ancient one, the giver of life. Thou art the life-giver to men, 
        to beasts, and to all growing things. Thou dost make every plant grow, every fruit bear its seed. In thee the land is fertile, 
        and the soil brings forth its yield. Thou hast established the seasons, the harvest, and the planting of the crops. Thou art the eternal source of fertility, 
        the sacred river that nourishes the earth. The hymn speaks to the reverence with which the Egyptians regarded the Nile, 
        its role in the sustenance of life, and the deep spiritual connection between the land, its people, and the gods.`,

        title: "Michel de Montaigne",
        text: `I study myself more than any other subject. That is my metaphysics, that is my physics. I am always prepared to receive truth from any quarter it comes. 
        Every man bears the whole stamp of the human condition, Montaigne wrote. Through the intimate and reflective essays that make up *The Essays*, 
        he examines the human experience from the inside out, exploring questions of identity, morality, and the nature of knowledge itself. Montaigne's writing is filled 
        with introspection and intellectual curiosity, seeking to uncover the contradictions within human nature. He invites readers to engage with the world 
        in a deeply personal way, not merely as passive observers but as active participants in the search for meaning. In Montaigne's view, the true path to wisdom 
        lies in understanding oneself, for only by doing so can we hope to understand the broader world. His thoughts resonate even today as we continue our own 
        quest for self-discovery and understanding.`,

        title: "Genesis",
        text: `In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 

God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters...

From dust to living breath, creation poured forth word by word. Land separated from sea. Stars placed with purpose. Creatures crawling, flying, swimming—the world teeming with order. And man, formed of clay, given dominion, yet called to tend and walk in humility.

Even now, the echoes of Genesis speak not just of beginnings, but of the mystery at the heart of life itself.`,

        text: `The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. 

The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of all things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations. 

These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.

If you understand others, you are smart. If you understand yourself, you are illuminated. If you conquer others, you are strong. If you conquer yourself, you are mighty.

To yield is to be full. To be content with little is true wealth. The Tao flows endlessly, silently, in all things. It does not strive, yet all things are done.

Let go of control, embrace stillness. This is the way of the Tao.`,

Wise men see all beings with equal vision. The soul is neither born, nor does it die. It is eternal, beyond time. Just as a person sheds worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, the soul discards a worn-out body and enters a new one.

Arjuna, rise up and fight with peace in your heart. Renounce the fruits, not the action. He who acts without selfish desire is untouched by karma.

Meditation, devotion, and selfless service are all paths to the Divine. But of all yogis, the one who worships Me with unwavering love is the highest.`,
